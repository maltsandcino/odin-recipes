    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a description of crepes and how to make them. Crepes should be fried one by one in a pan, and remain relatively thin. When you have completed cooking them, it is advised to garnish them in some way to complement their basic flavour. You may add whatever type of garnish you wish, frequently a sweet garnish is chosen.</p>
